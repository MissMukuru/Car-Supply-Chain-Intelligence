Having learnt a small part of data science and analytics, i have decided to put my little skills to the test by doing a mini unguided project.

The data set obtained was from kaggle.

The dataset was reduced to a managable size of 1004 entries and using pandas i did the following.
        *Scanned the dataset for any potential missing values
        *Did a rough statistical analysis of the data using the stats() method
        *Figured out the mmost import element of my data which was the sales and the discount columns
Numpy helped me do tthe following
        *finding the mean, mode, std, count and the maximum value
        *Convert the sales and the discount columns to arrays for better numerical analysisi
        *Multiply the dicount table by the sales table
        *Add the total sum odf the sales after the dicount
        *did the 9Normalised version of the tale

from there I played around with some visualization on matplotlib and seaborn
